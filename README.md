# JTools1.0
The JTools library is a set of tools built with the intent of making mathematical operations easier. In Version 1.0, this includes the JArray and JArrayDouble classes, designed for use similar to ArrayLists. The intent is for these to function as dynamic arrays. Functionality is still limited at this stage, but more iterations are in the works.
